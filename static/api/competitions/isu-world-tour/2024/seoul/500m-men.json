His split times reveal a steady pace—never overcommitting, always conserving energy for the final push. Teun Boer followed suit in his heat, finishing fourth but advancing via repechage, showing resilience after recent surgery. Itzhak de Laat, ever the veteran, used strategic positioning to qualify despite a slower 41.041, drawing on years of experience to avoid traffic. With all three NED men through to later rounds, their pacing suggests strong medal contention if execution holds under pressure.",

His clean lane control and consistent lap times—never dropping outside the top rank—forced Rostyslav Leontenko into reactive positioning, though the Ukrainian held composure to secure a qualifying spot. Jonathan Moody’s outside draw hampered early momentum, costing critical ground in the pack; despite a strong final lap, he couldn’t close the gap. Kosei Hayashi showed tactical patience from lane five, accelerating through the middle laps to nearly overtake Moody, while Brandon Pok faded late after an aggressive opening, undone by inefficient cornering. The absence of penalties spared disqualifications, but positioning errors proved decisive. With Kuczyński stamping himself as a medal threat and Leontenko advancing as a fastest loser, the quarterfinals loom as a proving ground for rising contenders and seasoned challengers alike.",
