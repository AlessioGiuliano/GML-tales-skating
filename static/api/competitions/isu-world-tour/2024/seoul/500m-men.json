Competing consistently on the ISU World Cup and World Tour circuits, Akar has achieved notable results including a fourth-place finish in the 1000m at the 2022 World Cup in Salt Lake City. Born in Erzurum, he began skating on makeshift ice with bags on his feet before receiving his first pair of skates from a coach, highlighting the humble beginnings that shaped his determined approach to the sport. A devout competitor, Akar prays before races and cites his brother Burak as the most influential figure in his career, while aiming for Olympic success at Milan-Cortina 2026 and a future as a short track coach.",

Born in the Netherlands but raised in Canada until age 12, Van 't Wout credits his brother Melle—also a competitive short tracker—for much of his development, training closely with him and even sharing hotel rooms and video analysis sessions.
