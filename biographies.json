{"NED": [{"skater_id": 18, "skater_firstname": "Avalon", "skater_lastname": "Aardoom", "biography": "Avalon Aardoom is a retired Dutch short track speed skater who competed internationally, achieving her best result with a second-place finish in the overall standings at the 2018 Dutch Championships. She participated in multiple ISU World Cup events between 2016 and 2018, with her top performance being a 7th place in the 1000 m at the 2018 Calgary World Cup, and she also represented the Netherlands at the 2017 World Junior Championships. Born with supraventricular tachycardia, a heart condition that caused her heart to beat abnormally fast, she underwent surgery in 2014 and ultimately retired in March 2020 when the condition made continued competition too risky, ending her Olympic dreams. Beyond skating, Avalon is passionate about drawing, painting, and baking, and follows a personal ritual of putting on her right skate before her left. She cites Korean skater Choi Min-Jeong as her idol and has long been motivated by the belief that \u201cquitting is not an option,\u201d despite facing significant health challenges throughout her career."}]}
